The game uses the arrow keys to move the player.  More than one key can be pressed at the same time
making it possible to move diagonally.

There is also a speed-up when pressing the CTRL key.

Player should collect charms position on the table and evade the bugs present.  The more charms collected, the faster
and more abundant the bugs will be.

Player will be reset to its position if touch by one of the bugs or if it falls into the water.
